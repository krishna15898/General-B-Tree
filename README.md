# General-B-Tree
A C code for a general B-tree

This is an implmentation of multi-ary tree (entries are numbers) of user given value of maximum children or n. This supports basic operation of adding,
deleting and, searching for an entry. You can also print the Tree in three ways, namely- in, pre, and post order.
Edit: Seems like this is a early version of the code and doesn't support printing in the three different ways. Just print it all In order.
